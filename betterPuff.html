        <h2>Halal Curry Puffs Singapore</h2>
        
        <p>Every Old Chang Kee curry puff is painstakingly prepared - zesty curried potatoes, succulent bite-sized chicken chunks and slices of boiled egg mixes with a perfect combination of herbs and spices to create the flawless flavour and texture that Singaporeans have loved over the last 60 years.</p>

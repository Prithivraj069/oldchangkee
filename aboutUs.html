        <h1> About Us - Our Heritage</h1>
        <p>Serving The World The Good Old Taste of Old Chang Kee</p>
        
        <h2>1956 - Our Humble Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Old Chang Kee has its humble beginnings in 1956 in a small stall in a coffee shop near the then Rex Cinema along Mackenzie Road. People from every corner of Singapore would travel to this stall to savor the perfect curry puff, then known affectionately as the "Rex Curry Puff".
    
            Singaporeans have fond memories of the pleasure of every bite of the puff. They loved the delicious puff, painstakingly made and stuffed with a slice of egg, curry potato and chicken, all fried with specially selected spices and herbs. The unmistaken aroma of Old Chang Kee curry puff has since won the hearts of many Singaporeans, both young and old</p>

            <h2>1986 - The 'New' Beginning</h2>
        <p>In 1986, Mr. Han Keen Juan made a pivotal decision that was to change his life as well as the food scene in Singapore. He traded a comfortable job with an established MNC for the hot and greasy kitchen of Old Chang Kee. With whatever savings he had, he bought over the control of the Old Chang Kee business. And he had only one goal in mind - to transform Old Chang Kee into a successful business.</p>

        <h2>Rapid Growth</h2>
         <p>With a clear vision, Mr. Han quickly set about modernizing and re-engineering the business. He moved the production of the curry puffs from a small corner in a coffee shop to a slightly larger premise in Ubi. New systems were implemented and critical steps were taken to ensure consistency in the quality of the products. He knew that to bring the business into the big league, he needed to continuously upgrade the production facility. In his true entrepreneur spirit, he later took another major decision. He invested in a 20,000 sq. feet modern production facility in Woodlands.
    
            Aggressive programmes were launched to grow Old Chang Kee into a leading brand of curry puffs and hot savouries. Mr. Han's efforts did not go unnoticed. He was awarded the Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1992 and Newsweek and the now defunct Asia Magazine named him as a man to watch.</p>
